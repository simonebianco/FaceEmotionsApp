# FaceEmotionsApp

The application is built using the Streamlit module with Python and is intended to provide a tool for faces and emotions detection. The model is created with Tensorflow Keras library usinng a Deep Convolution Neaural Network that can predict seven different emotions. For the face detection part an OpenCV API is integrated. The data consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. The faces have been automatically registered so that the face is more or less centred and occupies about the same amount of space in each image. The task is to categorize each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression into one of seven categories (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral). The training set consists of 28,709 examples and the public test set consists of 3,589 examples.
